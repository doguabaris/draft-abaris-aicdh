                      AI Content Disclosure Header
                       draft-abaris-aicdh-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a machine-readable Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) response header field, AI-Disclosure, to disclose the presence
   and degree of Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated or AI-assisted
   content in web responses.  The header is designed for compatibility
   with HTTP structured field syntax and provides metadata for user
   agents, bots, and archiving systems.  It supports layered disclosure
   strategies alongside human-readable and structured metadata formats.

1.  Introduction

   As AI-generated content proliferates across the web, users
   [BV-Report], platforms, and regulators increasingly demand
   transparent disclosure of algorithmic involvement in content creation
   [PAI-Framework].  Existing approaches to disclosure (e.g., HTML
   disclaimers) lack machine-readability [GV-Prov], making automation,
   indexing, and compliance challenging.

   This document defines the AI-Disclosure HTTP header field, providing
   a lightweight, machine-readable mechanism focused specifically on
   signaling the presence and mode of AI involvement in the generation
   of an HTTP response's content.  It utilizes HTTP Structured Fields
   [RFC9651] to offer a simple dictionary format directly within the
   HTTP response headers.

   The goal of AI-Disclosure is to offer a low-overhead, easily parsable
   signal primarily for automated systems like web crawlers, archiving
   tools, or user agents that may need a quick indication of AI usage
   without processing complex manifests.  This header is intended to be
   applied at the entire response level.

   It is important to distinguish this mechanism from more comprehensive
   content provenance and authenticity frameworks like the Coalition for
   Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) specification [C2PA-Spec].
   C2PA provides richer, cryptographically signed assertions about
   content provenance, potentially covering detailed creation/
   modification history and applying to specific regions within an asset
   ("Regions of Interest").  C2PA information can be linked via methods
   including the HTTP Link header [RFC8288] pointing to an associated
   manifest.

   AI-Disclosure can be seen as complementary to such systems within a
   layered disclosure strategy.  While C2PA offers strong, verifiable,
   and granular provenance, AI-Disclosure provides a simpler, advisory
   signal directly in the HTTP interaction for basic AI involvement
   awareness.  Systems requiring high assurance or sub-resource
   granularity should utilize frameworks like C2PA.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Acronyms and Abbreviations

   AI: Artificial Intelligence

   HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

   C2PA: Content Provenance and Authenticity, refers to the
   specification developed by the Coalition for Content Provenance and
   Authenticity

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Field Definition

   The AI-Disclosure field is defined as a Structured Field of type
   Dictionary, as described in [RFC9651].

   +===============+==========+========+========+===========+=========+
   | Header Field  |Structured|Template|Protocol|Status     |Reference|
   | Name          |Type      |        |        |           |         |

                                 Table 1

5.  Field Syntax

   The AI-Disclosure field value MUST conform to the syntax for
   Dictionary structures defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC9651].  Each key
   in the dictionary conveys a distinct aspect of AI disclosure.

5.1.  Example

   AI-Disclosure: mode=ai-originated;
                  model="gpt-4";
                  provider="OpenAI";
                  reviewed-by="editorial-team";
                  date=@1745286896

5.2.  Field Keys

        +=============+========+==================================+

                                  Table 2

6.  Semantics

   The AI-Disclosure header field is an optional and advisory header
   providing information about the use of AI in generating the response
   content.  Its presence indicates voluntary disclosure by the server.
   Absence of the header implies nothing about AI usage.

   The meaning of the header is primarily defined by the mode key, whose
   possible values are described below:

    +===================+=============================================+
    | Mode Value        | Description                                 |
    +===================+=============================================+
    | none              | Indicates that AI was not used in the       |
    |                   | creation or substantive modification of the |
    |                   | content.                                    |
    +-------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | ai-modified       | Indicates AI was used to assist with or     |
    |                   | modify content primarily created by humans. |
    |                   | The source material was not AI-generated.   |
    |                   | Examples include AI-based grammar checking, |
    |                   | style suggestions, or generating highlights |
    |                   | or summaries of human-written text.         |
    +-------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | ai-originated     | Indicates the core content was initially    |
    |                   | generated by AI but subsequently reviewed,  |
    |                   | edited, or significantly guided by humans.  |
    |                   | This suggests human oversight for accuracy  |
    |                   | or appropriateness, even if the originality |
    |                   | for copyright purposes might be affected.   |
    +-------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | machine-generated | Indicates the content was primarily or      |
    |                   | entirely generated by AI with minimal or no |
    |                   | human intervention or review post-          |
    |                   | generation.  AI may be responsible for      |
    |                   | substantive assertions or conclusions.      |
    +-------------------+---------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 3

   Other keys like model, provider, reviewed-by, and date provide
   optional, additional context about the AI model used, the provider,
   human review, or the generation time, respectively.

   Recipients should treat this header as informational only and refer
   to the Security Considerations (Section 7) regarding its
   trustworthiness.

   *Note:* The AI-Disclosure header applies to the entire content of the
   HTTP response payload.  The ai-modified and ai-originated values
   indicate AI involvement, but this header does not provide information
   about specific locations or the exact nature of the partial
   involvement.  For expressing provenance information about specific
   parts of a resource, more comprehensive mechanisms such as C2PA
   [C2PA-Spec] should be used.  The distinction between ai-modified and
   ai-originated aims to address whether the foundational content was
   human or AI, reflecting concerns about originality and the nature of
   the transformation.  The distinction between ai-originated and
   machine-generated primarily reflects the level of human review or
   intervention post-generation.

7.  Security Considerations

   The AI-Disclosure field is intended to provide advisory metadata
   about AI-generated or AI-assisted content and does not include any
   form of integrity protection.  As such, the field can be trivially
   spoofed or altered by intermediaries unless the response is delivered
   over a secure transport such as HTTPS.

   Clients and intermediaries MUST NOT rely on the presence, absence, or
   value of the AI-Disclosure field for making security-critical
   decisions.  The field is not authenticated and SHOULD be treated as
   untrusted input.

   This document does not define any mechanisms for cryptographic
   verification or provenance validation of the header's content.
   Implementations that require trustworthy disclosure metadata SHOULD
   rely on additional application-layer integrity mechanisms or signed
   metadata systems, such as those defined by C2PA [C2PA-Spec].

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the AI-Disclosure header field in the
   "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry" maintained
   at https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/), according to the
   procedures outlined in [RFC9110].
